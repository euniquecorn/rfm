                    PRODUCT CATALOG IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
                              RFM System
                         Date: October 18, 2025

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Implement complete product management system for clothing catalog with:
- MySQL database storage (catalog_clothing table)
- Cloudinary image hosting (with readable filenames)
- Tab-based archive system (Active/Archived products)
- Soft delete (products archived, not permanently deleted)
- No duplicate product names allowed

================================================================================
                        CLOUDINARY CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

WHAT YOU DID (Manual Setup):
----------------------------
1. Logged into Cloudinary Dashboard (https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. Went to Settings → Upload → Upload Presets
3. Edited "rfm_uploads" preset
4. Configured:
   ✓ "Use the filename of the uploaded file as the public ID" - SELECTED
   ✓ "Overwrite assets with the same public ID" - UNCHECKED
   ✓ "Append a unique suffix" - ENABLED (blue toggle ON)
5. Clicked SAVE

WHY THIS MATTERS:
-----------------
- Product images now use readable filenames instead of random IDs
- Example: "cool-blue-t-shirt-1729234567890" instead of "xk3j9d2f"
- Makes it easy to find and manage images in Cloudinary dashboard
- SEO-friendly image URLs
- Team can find images without database lookups

CREDENTIALS (For Reference):
----------------------------
Cloud Name: dpvrv7btt
API Key: 425947453244552
Upload Preset: rfm_uploads
Folder: rfm_products (where product images are stored)

================================================================================
                          SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

DATABASE STRUCTURE:
-------------------
Table: catalog_clothing

Fields:
- product_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- product_name (VARCHAR 255, UNIQUE) ← Prevents duplicates
- category (VARCHAR 100) ← Dropdown: T-Shirt, Polo, Hoodie, etc.
- base_price (DECIMAL 10,2) ← Philippine Peso, e.g., 299.50
- description (TEXT, optional)
- image_url (VARCHAR 500) ← Cloudinary secure_url
- cloudinary_public_id (VARCHAR 255) ← For image management
- status (ENUM: Active, Inactive, Archived) ← Soft delete support
- stock_quantity (INT, default 0)
- sku (VARCHAR 100, UNIQUE, optional)
- sizes (JSON, optional) ← For future size variants
- tags (JSON, optional) ← For future search/filtering
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)

Indexes:
- product_name (for searches)
- category (for filtering)
- status (for Active/Archived tabs)

IMAGE STORAGE:
--------------
- Images stored in Cloudinary (NOT in database)
- Database only stores the URL and public_id
- Filename format: "product-name-timestamp"
  Example: "cool-blue-t-shirt-1729234567890"
- Organized in folder: rfm_products/

API ENDPOINTS:
--------------
Base URL: http://localhost:3001/api/catalog

GET    /api/catalog              → Get all products (filter by status/category)
GET    /api/catalog/:id          → Get single product
POST   /api/catalog              → Create new product
PUT    /api/catalog/:id          → Update product
PATCH  /api/catalog/:id/archive  → Archive product (soft delete)
PATCH  /api/catalog/:id/restore  → Restore archived product
DELETE /api/catalog/:id          → Permanently delete (requires confirmation)

================================================================================
                              USER INTERFACE
================================================================================

PRODUCTS PAGE LAYOUT:
---------------------
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Add Product Button]                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Active Products (12)] [Archived Products (3)] │ ← Tabs
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐     │
│  │  Image   │  │  Image   │  │  Image   │     │

│  │[Edit][Archive]│[Edit][Archive]│[Edit][Archive]│
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ACTIVE TAB:
- Shows all products with status='Active'
- Buttons: [Edit] [Archive]
- Normal display

ARCHIVED TAB:
- Shows all products with status='Archived'
- Gray/faded appearance with "ARCHIVED" badge
- Buttons: [Restore] [Delete Forever]
- Products can be restored or permanently deleted

ADD PRODUCT MODAL:
------------------
Fields:
1. Product Name* (text input) ← Must be unique
2. Category* (dropdown) ← 24 clothing categories
3. Base Price* (text input) ← Peso format: ₱0.00
4. Description (textarea, optional)
5. Product Image* (file upload) ← JPG, PNG, SVG (max 5MB)

Workflow:
1. User fills in all fields
2. User selects image (shows local preview)
3. User clicks "Save Product"
4. System uploads image to Cloudinary with product name as filename
5. System saves product to database with image URL
6. Product appears in Active Products tab
7. Success message shows at top of page (outside modal)

VALIDATION MESSAGES:
--------------------
Inside Modal (alerts):
- "Please fill in all required fields"
- "Please enter valid price"
- "Please select image"
- "Invalid file type"
- "File too large"

Outside Modal (global messages at top):
- "📤 Uploading image to Cloudinary..." (blue/info)
- "✓ Image uploaded successfully!" (green/success)
- "✗ Failed to upload image" (red/error)
- "💾 Saving product..." (blue/info)
- "✓ Product saved successfully!" (green/success)
- "✗ Product name already exists" (red/error)

================================================================================
                              KEY FEATURES
================================================================================

1. NO DUPLICATE PRODUCTS:
   - Product names must be unique (database constraint)
   - Cloudinary filenames include timestamp (guaranteed unique)
   - User gets clear error if duplicate name attempted

2. SOFT DELETE (ARCHIVE):
   - "Delete" button actually archives (status='Archived')
   - Archived products can be restored
   - Nothing is permanently lost unless admin confirms
   - Permanent delete requires double confirmation

3. IMAGE NAMING:
   - Product name automatically becomes image filename
   - Example: "Cool Blue T-Shirt" → "cool-blue-t-shirt-1729234567890.jpg"
   - Easy to find in Cloudinary dashboard
   - Timestamp prevents collisions

4. PRICE HANDLING:
   - Display: ₱299.00 (with peso symbol)
   - Storage: 299.00 (DECIMAL in database)
   - Input: Auto-formats as user types
   - When focused: Shows clean number for editing
   - When blurred: Shows formatted ₱X.XX

5. CATEGORY MANAGEMENT:
   - Dropdown with 24 pre-defined clothing categories
   - Prevents typos and ensures consistency
   - Easy to filter products by category later

================================================================================
                          ISSUES FIXED IN PLAN
================================================================================

Issue #1: Product Name Collisions
- Problem: "Cool Blue T-Shirt" and "Cool Blue T Shirt" both become same filename
- Fix: Added timestamp suffix → always unique

Issue #2: Database Duplicates
- Problem: No constraint preventing duplicate product names
- Fix: Added UNIQUE constraint on product_name column

Issue #3: Unused HttpClient
- Problem: Imported but never used in CloudinaryService
- Fix: Removed from constructor

Issue #4: Missing Import
- Problem: Used computed() but didn't import it
- Fix: Added to Angular imports

Issue #5: Missing editProduct Method
- Problem: Template calls it but method doesn't exist
- Fix: Added stub method (full implementation later)

Issue #6: Silent Load Failures
- Problem: No error message if products fail to load
- Fix: Added error handling with user-facing messages

Issue #7: Unclear Cloudinary Config
- Problem: Instructions weren't specific enough
- Fix: Added step-by-step guide (which you just completed!)

Issue #8: Base Price Handling
- Status: Already handled with parseFloat() in original plan

Issue #9: Database Index
- Status: Already optimal (regular index for exact matches)

================================================================================
                              MONITORING
================================================================================

HOW TO CHECK IF SYSTEM IS WORKING:
-----------------------------------
1. Products Page: Should load without errors
2. Add Product: Should upload image and save to database
3. Cloudinary Dashboard: Images should appear with readable names
4. Active Tab: Should show active products
5. Archive Tab: Should show archived products
6. Browser Console: No JavaScript errors
7. Network Tab: API calls should return 200/201 status codes

COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:
--------------------------
Issue: "Product name already exists"
→ Solution: Use a different product name

Issue: Images not uploading
→ Check: Cloudinary preset configured correctly
→ Check: Internet connection
→ Check: File size < 5MB

Issue: Products not showing
→ Check: Backend server running (port 3001)
→ Check: Database connected
→ Check: Browser console for errors

Issue: "Failed to load products"
→ Check: Backend API is accessible
→ Check: MySQL server running
→ Check: catalog_clothing table exists
