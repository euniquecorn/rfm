================================================================================
                          WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

✅ BACKEND (Complete):
----------------------
1. Database Table: catalog_clothing
   - Created in backend/src/config/database.ts
   - Fields: product_id, product_name (UNIQUE), category, base_price, description,
     image_url, cloudinary_public_id, status, stock_quantity, sku, sizes, tags
   - Indexes for performance on: category, status, product_name

   - getProducts() - Get all products with optional filtering by category/status
   - getProduct() - Get single product by ID
   - updateProduct() - Update product fields
   - archiveProduct() - Soft delete (status = 'Archived')
   - restoreProduct() - Restore archived product
   - deleteProductPermanently() - Hard delete (IRREVERSIBLE)

3. API Routes (backend/src/routes/catalog.routes.ts):
   - GET /api/catalog - Get all products (with filters)

                          HOW TO TEST THE SYSTEM
================================================================================

STEP 1: START THE BACKEND
--------------------------
cd backend
npm run dev

Expected output:
✅ Database connected successfully
✅ Database tables initialized successfully
🚀 RFM Backend API server listening on http://localhost:3001

STEP 2: START THE FRONTEND
---------------------------
(In a new terminal, from project root)
ng serve

Expected output:
✔ Browser application bundle generation complete.
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200

STEP 3: OPEN YOUR BROWSER
--------------------------
Navigate to: http://localhost:4200
Login as admin
Go to: Admin → Products

STEP 4: TEST FEATURES
---------------------
✅ 1. View Empty State:
   - Should see "No active products yet" message
   - Click "Add Your First Product" button

✅ 2. Add Product:
   - Fill in product name (e.g., "Cool Blue T-Shirt")
   - Select category (e.g., "T-Shirt")
   - Enter price (e.g., 299.00)
   - Add description (optional)
   - Upload image (JPG, PNG, SVG, max 5MB)
   - Click "Save Product"

   - Click "Archive" button on a product
   - Confirm the dialog
   - Product disappears from Active tab
   - Switch to "Archived Products" tab
   - Product appears with "ARCHIVED" badge and grayscale effect

✅ 5. Restore Product:
   - In Archived tab, click "Restore" button
   - Product moves back to Active tab immediately

✅ 6. Delete Permanently:
   - Archive a product first
   - In Archived tab, click "Delete Forever" button
   - Confirm the WARNING dialog
   - Product is permanently removed from database

✅ 7. Check Cloudinary:
   - Login to Cloudinary dashboard
   - Navigate to Media Library
   - Look for "rfm_products" folder
   - Images should have readable names like:
     "cool-blue-t-shirt-1729234567890"

                          COMMON TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

❌ PROBLEM: Products not loading
✅ SOLUTION:
   1. Check backend is running on port 3001
   2. Check MySQL server is running (XAMPP)
   3. Check browser console for errors
   4. Verify API URL in src/environments/environment.ts

❌ PROBLEM: "Failed to upload image"
✅ SOLUTION:
   1. Check internet connection
   2. Verify Cloudinary credentials in environment.ts
   3. Check file size (must be < 5MB)
   4. Check file type (JPG, PNG, SVG only)
   5. Verify "rfm_uploads" preset exists in Cloudinary

❌ PROBLEM: "Product name already exists"
✅ SOLUTION:
   - This is normal! Product names must be unique
   - Choose a different product name
   - Or delete/archive the existing product first

❌ PROBLEM: Backend won't start
✅ SOLUTION:
   1. Check port 3001 is not in use
   2. Run: npm install (in backend folder)
   3. Check MySQL is running (XAMPP control panel)
   4. Check database credentials in backend/.env

❌ PROBLEM: Frontend won't start
✅ SOLUTION:
   1. Check port 4200 is not in use
   2. Run: npm install (in project root)
   3. Check Node.js version (should be 18+)

================================================================================
                          NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)
================================================================================

1. ✅ TEST THOROUGHLY:
   - Add multiple products
   - Test all actions (archive, restore, delete)
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Test error scenarios

2. 💾 BACKUP YOUR WORK:
   - Commit to Git
   - Push to your repository

3. 📸 CHECK CLOUDINARY:
   - Verify images are uploading correctly
   - Check filenames are readable
   - Verify folder structure (rfm_products/)

4. 🎨 IMPLEMENT EDIT PRODUCT (Future):
   - Pre-fill modal with product data
   - Allow image replacement
   - Handle update API call

5. 🔍 ADD SEARCH/FILTER (Future):
   - Category dropdown filter
   - Price range filter
   - Text search

6. 📊 ADD ANALYTICS (Future):
   - Total products count
